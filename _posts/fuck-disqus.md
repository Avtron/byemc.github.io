Hello there! As some of my Twitter followers would know, I recently posted a *really* colourful Tweet entitled "*Fuck Disqus*"

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fuck you <a href="https://twitter.com/disqus">@disqus</a>. Actually. Fuck. You. You added ads to my comments, and I didnâ€™t know about it until I checked a post on a browser without an ad blocker. Moving comment provider. I guess I shove looked carefully. <a href="https://t.co/Zo74VarHtB">pic.twitter.com/Zo74VarHtB</a></p>&mdash; ByeMC (@_ByeMC) <a href="https://twitter.com/_ByeMC/status/1402533505100300288">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

In short, I loaded up my website on my iPhone, looking at Safari through the iOS 15 beta. I tapped on my post and... what? What is this ad on my website!? I didn't put those there!
So I quickly searched up if Disqus used ads (the ads appeared above and below Disqus, but below the *Comments* header), and... yes. It does. 

Mad that I hadn't seen this sooner, I hastily plotted out this Tweet and went to school.
