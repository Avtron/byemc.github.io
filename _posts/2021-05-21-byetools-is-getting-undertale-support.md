So, recently I decieded to start playing [Undertale](https://undertale.com/), and after about *two hours*(!) I decided to change up my save game. Unfortunatly, Annoying Dog had other ideas.

So, what about stopping this? There is a tool called [UndertaleSandbox](https://github.com/jD91mZM2/UndertaleSandbox) that can do this, but I find it restrictive and hard to use. How about rephrasing the question to "So, what can *I* do about stopping this?"

I'll keep you updated.
